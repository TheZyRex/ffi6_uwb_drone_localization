Note: Due to an issue in the re-initialisation of the receiver, it is necessary to apply a receiver reset after
an error or timeout event (i.e. RXPTO (Preamble detection Timeout), RXSFDTO (SFD timeout), RXPHE (PHY
Header Error), RXRFSL (Reed Solomon error), RXRFTO (Frame wait timeout), etc.). This ensures that the
next good frame will have correctly calculated timestamp. For details on how to apply a receiver-only
reset see SOFTRESET field of Sub-Register 0x36:00 â€“ PMSC_CTRL0.

Maybe status!
If IDLE we can try to reconnect or log stuff, if not idle we have to send/receive etc.
